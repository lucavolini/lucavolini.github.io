# **Competitions**

This is a comprehensive list of Kaggle competitions I've joined.

Competitions are grouped by type.

For each competition python code is provided along with competition's goal, evaluation metric
and score achieved.

A list of steps that embodies the backbone of the analysis and model's building is also
provided as well as key takeaways for each step.

All data is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).
